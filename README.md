# Hotel-Management-System
In this repository is a simple hotel management system webpage I developed in my first year at university, it uses html, css and php to do this allowing users to create a booking and check it a database to check room availability depending on the users/ customers requirements. It also allows users to update, delete and add rooms, hotels, guests and room types to a SQLite database which can also be viewed in the webpage.
